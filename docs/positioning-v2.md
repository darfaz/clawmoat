# ClawMoat v2 Positioning — "Run AI Agents on Your Laptop Without Fear"

## The Shift

**Before:** "Security scanner for AI agents" (feature)
**After:** "The trust layer between AI agents and your machine" (category)

## New Tagline Options

1. **"Run AI agents on your laptop. We watch your back."**
2. **"Your machine. Your agent. Your rules."**
3. **"The security moat between AI and your laptop."**
4. **"Self-host AI agents fearlessly."**

Recommended: **"Your machine. Your agent. Your rules."**

## Target Audience (Revised)

### Primary: Self-Hosting AI Agent Users
- People running OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, etc. on their actual machines
- Want the power of local agents but scared of giving AI shell/file access
- Technical enough to install npm packages, not security experts
- **Pain point:** "I want to run this on my laptop but what if it reads my SSH keys?"

### Secondary: Agent Framework Developers
- Building with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI Agents SDK
- Need to ship security to their users without building it themselves
- Want to say "secured by ClawMoat" as a trust signal

### Tertiary: Enterprise AI Teams
- Deploying agents internally on employee machines
- Need compliance, audit trails, policy enforcement
- Can't have agents accessing arbitrary credentials

## Value Proposition

```
Without ClawMoat:
  AI Agent → Full access to everything → 😱

With ClawMoat:
  AI Agent → ClawMoat Guardian → Only what's allowed → 😌
  + Full audit trail of everything attempted
  + Forbidden zones auto-protect your credentials
  + Permission tiers you can dial up as trust grows
```

## Why This Pricing Works

2. **Pro sells peace of mind** — "I run an agent on my laptop, I need alerts when something weird happens"
3. **Team sells visibility** — "I have 5 engineers running agents, I need to see what they're doing"
4. **Enterprise sells compliance** — "Our security team needs audit trails and SLA"
